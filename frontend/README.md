# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm, pnpm, yarn, etc, installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en

## Installation:

- Clone this repository:
```
Bash

$ git clone git@github.com:MAZTRO/sorting_visualizer.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory:

```
Bash

$ cd sorting_visualizer
```

- Install dependencies:

```
Bash

$ pnpm install
```

## Running the Application:

- Start the development server:

```
Bash

$ pnpm dev
```
This will start the server and open the application in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:5000/.

# Building for Production:

Build the optimized production bundle:
```
Bash
$ pnpm run build
```
This will create a production-ready build in the **/build/dist** folder.

### Development:

Code changes are automatically reflected in the browser without manual reloads during development mode (using pnpm run dev).
Feel free to explore the codebase, modify components, and experiment with different sorting algorithms.
