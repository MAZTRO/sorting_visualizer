# sorting_visualizer
This project is a sorting visualizer web application built with React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to explore different sorting algorithms and visualize their execution in real-time.

- Interactive Sorting: Users can choose from various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

- Data Set Control: Users can adjust the size of the data set to be sorted, allowing visualization of algorithm performance at different scales.

- Visual Representation: The data is represented as bars on the screen, with their height or color corresponding to the value. The sorting process is animated, highlighting comparisons and swaps between elements.

- Speed Control: Users can control the animation speed of the sorting process, allowing them to observe the algorithm's steps in detail or speed up the visualization.

## Technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Typescript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing for improved code maintainability and catching errors early.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building responsive designs.

In the past, I've delved into sorting algorithms by implementing them in C. This experience provided a strong foundation in their logic and efficiency. Now, I'm excited to revisit these algorithms and apply them within the React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS stack I'm currently using. This will allow me to bridge the gap between my algorithmic knowledge and a modern web development environment.
